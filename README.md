This is a way to see if a garage is closed any MAYBE close it remotely(Most likey not a good idea)
this will use a raspberry pi zero 2 as a web server and to operate a sense hat.
this will use 2 microbits to see where the garage is and use a pico w to commucate with one of the microbits. they will comucate with eachother with 
the internal radio of the microbits.
a pico w will commucate with the microbit and some leds to make sure its working. 
bluetooth will let the raspberry pi pico and the zero commucate
